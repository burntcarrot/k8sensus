# k8sensus

Trying to build a leader election process for Kubernetes using the Kubernetes `client-go` client.

## Why?

To make systems more fault-tolerant; handling failures in replicas is crucial for higher availability.

## How?

- [x] Start by creating a lock object.
- [ ] Make leader update/renew lease. (inform other replicas about its leadership)
- [ ] Make candidate pods check the lease object.
- [ ] If leader fails, re-elect new leader.
